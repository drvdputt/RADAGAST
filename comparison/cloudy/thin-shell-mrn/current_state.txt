This text file describes my impression of how well my code compares to cloudy

Emission (and input) spectrum:
______________________________

The shape looks more or less ok, but there is still and offset of a few orders of magnitude due
to the units. It's kind of weird since the input spectrum seems to work just fine.

Heating / temperature:
________

For mostly ionized conditions, the heating looks fine. This means that the calculation of the
photoionization heating is fine.

For H2 regions, the (direct) dissociation heating can be important. I still need to implement this.

Also, I should print out different heating contributions. My heating is much higher sometimes,
while the temperature seems fine.

Grains:
_______

My code has no grain emission. I haven't found a way yet to turn off the grain emission in
cloudy. The size distribution slope looks fine, and I have the same number of grain size bins
within the same range. The sizes are not exactly the same though, and the abundances seem higher
in cloudy. This might be due to average radius vs average area vs average volume. But I have
added a function to cloudy which writes out the number densities, and it seems fine.

The grain heating is within the same order of magnitude. I haven't checked the grain charges
yet, which is another check that both value might be reasonable.

Checking the grain extinction/opacity would be another way to check that the amount I put in is
correct.

Densities:
__________

Again, the ionization balance works fine, but H2 is mostly off in my code.

Rates:
______

h2form: Grain H2 formation is off by a factor of 10, which of course has a big effect. Using
ELRD in cloudy apparently should use equation C.1 from rollig et al. (2013?). But it's still
much higher. Should do further checking.

h2dissoc: Correct up to 1% when all the H2 levels are used. Should check what the main
contribution is though (direct vs Solomon)

hphotoion: Correct when the

hcolion: didn't check because it's negligible for our use case. Having some form of collisional
ionization can be useful for computational stability though.

hrec: fine at higher temperatures. Off by ~25%
