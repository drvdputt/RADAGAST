\mainpage Introduction

This project provides a way to calculate the state of pure hydrogen gas given a certain
radiation field. It is a 0D model, and the aim is that it can be used in 3D dust radiative
transfer simulations. While <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be">SKIRT</a> is our main target, we
have made this a standalone module which, ideally, does not depend on SKIRT in any way. It
should be possible to use this module in any C++ code where the necessary environment parameters
can be provided.

\ref build_page Instructions for building the gas module as a standalone library, which can then
be called from your script or simulation.

\ref example_page Explanation of the interface, including examples showing how to use it.
